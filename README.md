| `session`            | string  | WPPConnect Server Instance ID.                                                                 | `""`          |
| `base_url`           | string  | JIVAS Base URL (your application's base URL).                                                  | `""`          |
| `webhook_url`        | string  | JIVAS webhook endpoint for receiving WPPConnect messages.                                      | `""`          |
| `request_timeout`    | float   | Length of time (in seconds) this action waits for the API to complete a request.               | `10.0`        |

| `use_pushname`       | bool    | Use the WhatsApp push name as the user name when set to `True`.                                | `True`        |
| `ignore_newsletters` | bool    | Ignore newsletter messages when set to `True`.                                                 | `True`        |

---

**Note:**
 - All parameters should be set according to your WPPConnect Server and JIVAS deployment.
 - `webhook_url` should be a publicly accessible endpoint that WPPConnect can POST to, in order to allow for event-driven communication.

---

### Best Practices

- **Validate** your API keys, tokens, and webhook URLs before deploying in production.
- **Test** the webhook registration and sample message flow in a staging environment first.
- Adjust `chunk_length` if you have use cases that involve very long text messages.
- Use `ignore_newsletters` and `ignore_forwards` to filter out less relevant messages and avoid unnecessary processing.
